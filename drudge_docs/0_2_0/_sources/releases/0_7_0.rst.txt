0.7.0
-----

This releases adds some convenience operations defined for tensorial objects,
like direct negation and division by scalars.  For instance, to negate a tensor
``t``, now we can just write ``-t`` instead of the more cumbersome ``-1 * t``.
Similarly, to divide it by two, we can now just write ``t / 2``, compared with
the previous syntax of::

    t * sympy.Rational(1, 2).

The examples for CC theories are also updated for the new syntax.  And some
other convenience enhancements are added.  For instance, now LaTeX or pdf report
can directly be generated, with the structure of the report more flexible and
tunable.  And the LaTeX formatting is enhanced with more options to fine tune
its behaviour.  Also ``memoize`` method is added to the ``Drudge`` class for the
convenience of caching intermediate results.

Also multiple bugs are fixed,

* Now the code no longer crashes when a deltas contains no dummy.

* Incorrectness from highly cyclic delta resolution result is fixed.

* The dummies in simplified result for particle-hole problems are made
  conventional.

* Simplification of ``TensorDef`` now resets external dummies as well.

* Core dependency ``libcanon`` is updated to 0.1.2 such that the erroneous
  requirement of twice simplification for some complex expressions is fixed.

* A PySpark bug in ``reduce`` is circumvented by doing boolean reduction
  locally.
