0.2.0
-----

In this release, major revisions and enhancements have been made to the drudge
package.  Primarily,

1. TensorDef class are added to support better substitution and direct indexing.

2. Drudge.einst and Drudge.sum has been revised to work with existing tensors.

3. Variable-valence symmetry are supported and used in many-body drudges.

4. The timing facility has been renamed to Matlab convention.

Since the code has not yet been widely deployed, a few changes might break
backward compatibility,

1. act method of tensor is removed.

2. set_name method of drudge is updated to a new interface.

3. Timing facility is renamed.
