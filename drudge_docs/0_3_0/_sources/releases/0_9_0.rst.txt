0.9.0
-----

This is a relatively small release fixing problems found in the initial lessons
of using the drudge script.  Specifically, bugs with pickling symbols in drudge
scripts has been fixed.  Also, generally better error handling and reporting
can be seen in using drudge scripts.  To facilitate advanced manipulation
inside drudge scripts, tensors are also given a full pack of three core
manipulation functions, ``map``, ``filter``, and ``bind``.  Also, the
documentation has been improved.
