0.7.0
-----

This releases adds some convenience operations defined for tensorial objects,
like direct negation and division by scalars.  For instance, to negate a tensor
``t``, now we can just write ``-t`` instead of the more cumbersome ``-1 * t``.
Similarly, to divide it by two, we can now just write ``t / 2``, compared with
the previous syntax of::

    t * sympy.Rational(1, 2).

The examples for CC theories are also updated for the new syntax.  Also multiple
bugs are fixed,

* Now the code no longer crashes when a deltas contains no dummy.

* Incorrectness from highly cyclic delta resolution result is fixed.

* The dummies in simplified result for particle-hole problems are made
  conventional.

* Simplification of ``TensorDef`` now resets external dummies as well.

* Core dependency ``libcanon`` is updated to 0.1.2 such that the erroneous
  requirement of twice simplification for some complex expressions is fixed.
